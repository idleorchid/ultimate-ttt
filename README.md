# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

An implementation of the extended version of [Tic Tac Toe](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/), in Python, using PyQt for the GUI.
This implementation also features code for AI, using both minimax algorithm and [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search). The latter still requires work to make it effective, while the former is not particularly suitable due to the sheer number of moves it would have to consider each time.
